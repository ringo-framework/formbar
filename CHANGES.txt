TODO
====

- Added Testcases for i18n.
- Added a configurable JS-Callback function which is called when the user
  changes the currently selected page. The function will sent some information
  (selected page, item, itemid) to a configurable URL. The server behind the
  URL can save these values in a session and reuse it to preselect the page on
  the next form rendering.

Form-Rendering:

- Splitted up rendering of forms. The Fieldrenderer now renders label, field,
  help and errors seperately for each field.
- Enabled customs Renderers. Among the default FA Renderes wen can now
  configure our own renderers more easly. The goal is to  get rid of the FA
  Alchemy dependencie.

0.2.2
=====

- Added a new DatefieldRenderer which uses a bootstrap specific datepicker
  widget. Needs JS. Currently this widget is used if the datetype "date" is
  provided.
- Added helper method to get the needed JS code for formbar. Needed in other
  libraries.
- Renderer is not set depending on the datatype anymore. Default renderer is
  a TextfieldRenderer or the Renderer set by Formencode.
- Renderer is only set by the renderer attribute for an entity
- Fix in setup.py. Use hgtools to build package.
- Added support for pages in forms.
