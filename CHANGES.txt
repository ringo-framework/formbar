- Modified "onchange" event for textfield. Detect if user stopped typing in
  a textfield and trigger evaluation of rules after 750ms automatically.

0.9.13
======
- Fixed type detection for VARCHAR fields.

0.9.12
======
- Raise deserialisation error when time format ist wrong.

0.9.11

  changes in the form. Only evalute the conditionals which are affacted by the
  change.

0.9.10
======

  values and the form will renderer the differences to these values in a nice
  visual way in read only mode. This is very similar to the change history
  known from other office products.
- Fixed bug in evaluating expressions in JS when rendering read only mode. Add
  value attribute for readonly dropdown fields holding the unexpanded value.

  used to display dynamic calculated values.
- Added helper script "generate.py" to generate various information about the
  form configuration. E.g generate the SQLAlchemy model.
- Added optional request param for form initialisation. The current request
  from a wenframeform can no be provided to the form. This might be usefull
  while rendering with external renderers.

0.4.0
=====

- Removed FormAlchemy dependency. This includes some internal refactoring as
  the rendering and converting of values (especially relations) must now be
  done by formbar.

0.3.1
=====

- Fixed readonly view for textarea. Replace \n with <br>
- Added "in" rule operand. ($field in ['1','2','3'])

0.3
===

- Added a configurable JS-Callback function which is called when the user

  URL can save these values in a session and reuse it to preselect the page on
  the next form rendering.

Form-Rendering:
- Splitted up rendering of forms. The Fieldrenderer now renders label, field,
  help and errors seperately for each field.

  configure our own renderers more easly. The goal is to  get rid of the FA
  Alchemy dependencie.

  widget. Needs JS. Currently this widget is used if the datetype "date" is

  libraries.
- Renderer is not set depending on the datatype anymore. Default renderer is
  a TextfieldRenderer or the Renderer set by Formencode.
